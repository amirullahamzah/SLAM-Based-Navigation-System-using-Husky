SLAM-Based Navigation System with RTAB-Map and A* Algorithm for Mobile Robot Motion Planning in Constrained Enviroment is my Final Year Project
for Bachelor of Engineering (Hons.) Mechanical.

This project completed using husky_package and rtabmap_ros along with python code to make the robot can move autonomously when navigating in constrained enviroment.

The description for the code I produced is :

Husky Navigator used for navigating from point to point that have been setup earlier. 
It consist of 2 modes which is auto and manual. 
Manual mode is to setup the point file in json file and auto mode will run the husky to move autonomously from the points created.

Husky Tracker used for tracking distance of the Husky move from the odometry.
